# login-website

## Introduction
This website is hosted on GitHub Pages. It is a simple frontend that aims to introduce the concept of Web Development. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- **Feature 1: Login Page with Authentication**  
  The website begins with a login page (`index.html`), where users are required to enter the correct password ("********") to gain access to the main website. This provides an extra layer of security before redirecting to the main content.

- **Feature 2: Navigation with Clickable Buttons**  
  The main page (`website.html`) offers an intuitive navigation system with clickable buttons: **Home**, **About**, and **Help**. Clicking on the **Help** button redirects the user to the `help.html` page, ensuring smooth user experience and quick access to different sections of the website.

- **Feature 3: Feedback Form on Help Page**  
  The `help.html` page includes a feedback form where users can submit their thoughts, suggestions, or inquiries about the website. This feedback can help improve the site and provide better user support.

## Installation
To run the website locally, clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yash-Thakur-27/login-website.git
cd login-website
# Open index.html in a browser
